        <Summary xml:lang="en">Mock hardware devices for unit tests and bug reports</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">umockdev mocks Linux devices for creating integration tests for hardware
related libraries and programs. It also provides tools to record the
properties and behaviour of particular devices, and to run a program or
test suite under a test bed with the previously recorded devices loaded.
This allows developers of software like gphoto or libmtp to receive these
records in bug reports and recreate the problem on their system without
having access to the affected hardware.
